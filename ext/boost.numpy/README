Boost.NumPy is an extension for Boost.Python that adds NumPy support.

It is intended as a replacement for the old numeric support in
Boost.Python proper, which is now out-of-date and does not support
C/C++ pointer access to the data.  Because it builds against the NumPy
headers and hence has a dependency that Boost.Python does not, it is
intended to be built as a separate library.  This is also not intended
to be a high-level C++ array library; it would be more accurate to
consider it a C++ NumPy API, with the intent of making the NumPy C-API
available in a form that is safer and more convenient for C++ users
(and particularly those using Boost.Python, of course).

THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL BOOST LIBRARY

...we're just calling it Boost.NumPy right now because that clearly
indicates that it's for Boost.Python and NumPy.  We do intend to
propose it for inclusion in Boost eventually.

HISTORY/AUTHORS

Boost.NumPy was originally written by Jim Bosch as part of the
"ndarray" C++ library, then reorganized into a standalone component,
cleaned up, and documented as part of a Boost-sponsored
Google Summer of Code by Ankit Daftery, mentored by Stefan Seefeld.

The project is hosted both on the Boost Sandbox:

https://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/numpy

and on GitHub:
